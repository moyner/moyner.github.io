## Open Source Software

### MRST

### Jutul.jl

### JutulDarcy.jl

### MultiComponentFlash.jl

### BattMo.jl

### GeoEnergyIO.jl

In order to support scientific reproducibility, much of my research time is spent developing Open-Source solvers for simulation of flow in porous media as a part of the Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) and the Jutul / JutulDarcy simulators as well as battery simulation in BattMo.jl. The repositories for MRST are public on GitHub.
