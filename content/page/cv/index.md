Welcome to the professional webpage of Olav Møyner. I'm a senior research scientist in the [Applied Computational Sciences group](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/departments-new/department-of-mathematics-and-cybernetics/research-group-applied-computational-science/) at [SINTEF Digital](https://www.sintef.no/sintef-digital/), a [not-for-profit independent research institute](https://www.sintef.no/en/sintef-group/this-is-sintef/) in Norway. I can most easily be reached at [mail@olavmoyner.com](mailto:mail@olavmoyner.com).

## Research interests

- Solution methods for coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs)
- Automatic differentiation and adjoint methods
- Software design of industry grade simulators
- Flow and transport in porous media, with applications in hydrocarbon recovery, carbon capture and sequestration, geothermal energy and groundwater flow
- Numerical simulation of batteries
- Discretizations for unstructured meshes (high-order and consistent schemes)

### Awards

#### SIAM GS Early career prize

Awarded the 2019 [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Geosciences Activity Group Early Career Prize](https://siam-web.useast01.umbraco.io/publications/siam-news/articles/april-prize-spotlight-omar-ghattas-and-olav-m248yner/).

Prize citation: *The SIAM Activity Group on Geosciences (SIAG/GS) awards the SIAG/GS Early Career Prize to an individual in their early career for distinguished research contributions to the solution of mathematical and computational problems in the geosciences published in the three calendar years prior to the award year. The award recognizes Møyner for his elegant and insightful contributions to theory, algorithms, and software for multiscale porous flow simulation, and for his exceptional scholarly productivity and impact on practice.*

#### Dimitris N. Chorafas prize for best PhD thesis at NTNU

Awarded the 2016 [Dimitris N. Chorafas prize](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/wsos/about/dimitris-n-chorafas-prize/about-foundation-and-prize) given to a single PhD thesis at NTNU each year.

*The Dimitris N. Chorafas Foundation awards scientific prizes for outstanding work in selected fields in the engineering sciences, medicine and the natural sciences. It rewards research characterized by its high potential for practical application and by the special significance attached to its aftermath.  Every year, partner universities in Europe, North America and Asia evaluate the research work of their graduating doctorate students and propose the best for prizing.*
